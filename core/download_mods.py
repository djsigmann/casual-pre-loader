    # At certain points, the collection of mods was bundled with the preloader itself in the following files:
    # - `cukei_particle_preload.zip`
    # - `casual-particle-preloader.zip`
    # - `casual-preloader.zip`
    # The preloader was at one point released in two separate distribuitions, one with and one without the mods:
    # - `casual-preloader-full.zip`
    # - `casual-preloader-light.zip`
    # - There was also a time where the mods were kept in a zip file checked into the VCS...yeah, ~80 MB...per revision...
