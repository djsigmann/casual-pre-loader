"""
This module has a single function, `migrate()`, that ensures that old files are cleaned up or moved into new locations.
This is so that if we change things, users will have a (hopefully) seamless expereince.

For instance, let's say we write to a directory, `/dir/subdir`, but we decide that it'd be better to call it `/dir/subdir2`.
We'd add an entry in this file to move `/dir/subdir` to `dir/subdir2`, commit that, and generate a new minor (or major) release.

Generating a new release would technically not be strictly necessary,
but assuming that users make use of the auto-updater, they won't end up with broken program/data/config files.
The auto-updater repeatedly updates to the next non-downloaded minor/major release and calls `migrate()`,
meaning that we can remove all old migrations from `migrate()` every time we generate a new release.

Granted, users using a rolling-release package manager, e.g. pacman, or users using `git` directly could still end up with broken files,
since there is no way to tell pacman to update to only the next version instead of the latest,
nor could we tell pacman to run the program in between those updates.
Technically, programs like `downgrade` exist, or users could manually grab old packages, but this is irrelevant to AUR packages anyway.
ALl this aside, such users should usually be expected to have some knowledge about the programs they run and the packages they install,
so I'd say this is a tolerable shortcoming.

To try and mitigate this potential problem, it is recommended to not remove things from this file too often, once a month at the most should be fine.

`migrate()` only needs to be called once per program execution, so one should run `del core.migrations` afterwards so that the interpreter can gc the module.
